The problem is that you don't give enough information here.

MPEG can be really anything, four containers (including mp4) and also four codecs...

What most people call "MPEG" is actually mpeg2 video in an mpeg program stream container. 
You should be able to put that in an mp4 container (!) without re-encoding and also without
quality loss as a result.

FFmpeg does it like this: ffmpeg -i MPEG_file -vcodec copy -acodec copy -f mp4 MP4_file.mp4
